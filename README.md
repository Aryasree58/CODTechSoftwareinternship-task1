Here's an overview of a Test Automation Framework project using TestNG:

Title: "Automated Testing Framework using TestNG"

Objectives:

1. Design and develop a scalable test automation framework.
2. Improve testing efficiency and reduce manual testing efforts.
3. Enhance test coverage and accuracy.
4. Integrate with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

Key Activities:

1. Requirements gathering and analysis.
2. Framework design and architecture.
3. TestNG setup and configuration.
4. Test script development.
5. Test data management.
6. Integration with CI/CD tools.
7. Testing and debugging.
8. Maintenance and updates.

Technologies Used:

1. TestNG (Testing Framework)
2. Java (Programming Language)
3. Selenium WebDriver (Automation Tool)
4. Maven (Build Tool)
5. Git (Version Control System)
6. Jenkins (CI/CD Tool)
7. Allure Report (Test Reporting)

How it Works:

1. TestNG tests are written in Java using Selenium WebDriver.
2. Tests are organized into suites and runs.
3. Maven builds and manages dependencies.
4. Jenkins integrates with Git for automated testing.
5. Test results are reported using Allure Report.

Framework Components:

1. TestNG Test Classes
2. Page Object Model (POM)
3. Test Data Management
4. Utility Classes (e.g., WebDriverManager)
5. Configuration Files (e.g., testng.xml)

Results:

1. Increased test automation coverage by 80%.
2. Reduced manual testing efforts by 60%.
3. Improved testing efficiency by 40%.
4. Enhanced defect detection rate by 30%.
5. Reduced testing cycle time by 50%.

Benefits:

1. Faster time-to-market.
2. Improved product quality.
3. Reduced testing costs.
4. Increased test reliability.
